			<h1>Performance</h1>
			<p>In this section, we analyze the various factors that may impact a webserver's
			efficiency, the speed with which it may serve requests, and compare the different ways
			some servers handle these factors.</p>

			<h2>Network speed</h2> 
			<p>Both requests and responses have to be sent across a network, usually the Internet,
			in order to serve a site. The speed with which a request or response can be sent or
			received is dependent on both the server's and client's connection speed, and a limiting
			factor in how fast a request may be served.</p>
			<p>Ways for webservers (or clients) to use their bandwidth more efficiently are outlined
			in this subsection.</p>
			
				<h3>Caching</h3>
				<p>Reponses, especially static content such as images or Javascript, may be cached
				(temporarily stored by) by the client or an intermediate server in order to reduce
				load on the server, as the static content will be able to reach the client
				sooner.</p>

				<h3>Compression</h3>
				<p>The contents of both requests and responses may be compressed by the server and
				client, if both parties support this. Compression is negotiated via the
				<em>Accept-Encoding</em>
					<sup><a href="#fn-AE-1.0" id="ref-AE-1.0">1.0</a></sup>
					<sup><a href="#fn-AE-1.1" id="ref-AE-1.1">1.1</a></sup> 
				and <em>Content-Encoding</em>
					<sup><a href="#fn-CE-1.0" id="ref-CE-1.0">1.0</a></sup>
					<sup><a href="#fn-CE-1.1" id="ref-CE-1.1">1.1</a></sup>
				headers.</p>

				<p>However, compression requires additional computation by the client and server, as
				all content has to undergo an additional compression step. In order to migitate
				this, webservers may cache compressed data, and directly serve the pre-compressed
				data (so the server does not have to re-compress the data for each request).</p>

				<p>Compression algorithms that may be used are specified by the IANA.<sup>
					<a href="#fn-IANA-compression" id="ref-IANA-compression">link</a></sup>
				</p>

				<p>HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 only allow compression of the request or response body, but in
				HTTP/2 the request headers may be compressed as well.</p>

				<h3>Connection: keep-alive</h3>
				<p>By default, a new TCP connection is created for each request to a server, by
				performing the 3-way handshake: the client sends a packet requesting a connection to
				the server (SYN), the server acknowledges this request and requests a confirmation
				of this confirmation (SYN-ACK), and the client then confirms the connection and may
				begin sending data (ACK). This requires the client and server to wait 3 RTT (Round
				Trip Time), as the packets (sadly) do not appear instantly on their destination.</p>

				<p>When a request has been served, the connection to the server is closed again.
				This means that when the client wants to retrieve more content from the same server,
				either resources linked from a retrieved page or another page or unrelated content,
				the client will have to re-establish a connection to the server by performing the
				3-way handshake again. If the client and server were using a connection secured by
				HTTPS/SSL, re-establishing a connection is even more inefficient, as the secure
				connection requires 2 RTT and key computation by both client and server.<!--ref--></p>

				<p>This situation may be improved by not closing the connection after each request,
				but instead allowing the connection to be reused for potential following requests.
				Behaviour for this mechanism is negotiated using the <em>Connection</em> header, and
				varies across HTTP versions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In HTTP/1.0, connections are automatically closed unless specified by using
						the <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> header and keep-alive being
						supported by both client and server. Keep-alive was not specified in the RFC
						for HTTP/1.0 and was more of a unofficial add-on, so it was not always
						available.
					</li>
					<li>
						In HTTP/1.1, the <em>Connection</em> header was standardized, and
						connections were kept open unless explicitly specified using the
						<code>Connection: close</code> header.
						<sup><a href="#fn-1.1-persistence" id="ref-1.1-persistence">1.1</a></sup>
					</li>
					<li>
						In HTTP/2, like in HTTP/1.1, keep-alive is the default option, but HTTP/2
						contains several improvements to keep-alive connections, such as server
						push.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The following chart displays the amount of RTT required to retrieve <em>n</em>
				resources from a server (over a plain HTTP connection) with and without reusing the
				same connection (with and without keep-alive).</p>

				<div id="keepalive_chart" class="chart"></div>

				<p>The following chart displays the amount of RTT required to retrieve <em>n</em>
				resources from a server, using a HTTPS connection, with and without reusing the
				connection.</p>

				<div id="keepalive_https_chart" class="chart"></div>

				<p>As the charts show, keep-alive connections greatly reduce the overhead required
				to retrieve the content, especially when using HTTPS. Fortunately, keep-alive is the
				default connection state in HTTP/1.1 and should be widely used.
				<em>Un</em>fortunately, keep-alive increases the server load somewhat, as the server
				has to keep track of all connections that may or may not send additional requests,
				which may be expensive if there are many connected clients. More information on this
				problem may be found in <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-keepalives-and-web-performance/"
				title="HTTP Keepalive Connections and Web Performance">this post</a>, by the company
				behind nginx, a popular server.</p>

				<h3>TCP Pipelining</h3>
				<p>TCP Pipelining extends the keep-alive mechanism, as it relies on sending multiple
				requests at once, over the same TCP connection, without having to wait for the
				response of the first request. Pipelining is unfortunately not widely supported, as
				many browsers either do not implement pipelining or disable it by default. </p>
				<p>The following chart shows the amount of RTT required to retrieve <em>n</em>
				resources from a server without keep-alive, with keep-alive but without pipelining,
				and with pipelining (and keep-alive). The amount of requests that can be sent at the
				same time is not defined, but Mozilla recommends
				<sup><a href="#fn-moz-pipelining" id="ref-moz-pipelining">link</a></sup>
				a maximum of two requests at the same time. </p>
